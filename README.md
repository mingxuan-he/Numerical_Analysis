# Numerical_Analysis
I'm currently taking the MAT-317 Numerical Analysis course at Grinnell College, where I implement many numerical algorithms in Python (sometimes in MATLAB). I will be updating my code on Github along the way. 
Citations: Some code snippets, and most test files are taken from my instructor, prof. Jeffery Blanchard.
